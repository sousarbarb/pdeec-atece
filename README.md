# Simultaneous Odometry and Extrinsic Laser Calibration

This repository contains the work developed in the course Advanced Topics in
Electrical and Computers Engineering of the doctoral program in Electrical and
Computers Engineering (ECE) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of
Porto (FEUP).

The project developed in the course was focused in calibration simultaneously
the odometry and a 2D laser's extrinsic parameters of a mobile robot. The method
proposed in this work did not required the use of an external tracking system.
